For the last five years I have been working for a property management company in Portland, Oregon. Last year I began to feel burnt out from my property management job and an itch to do something new. Opportunities came to a standstill and my work days were becoming repetitive. I decided I wanted to move on to a new career path. Around the same time, my friend was telling me about a coding boot camp he was starting. I began to research coding and it seemed like the exact thing I was looking for.

Software Development is a long-term career that would allow me to be creative and would continue to present new challenges. Both of those things are what drove me to start Flatiron. Another intriguing factor was being able to work remotely and flexibility of schedule. I would love to have a career where I could work from any state at any time. Careers with new challenges, new opportunities, and flexibility are hard to come by.

My previous job lacked all the variables that a software development career offers. My goal now is to begin a career as a software developer by next summer. I am excited to start a new chapter in my life. I know Flatiron school will be a huge stepping-stone to get me where I want to go!
